      <h1>Senior Investment Analytics, Automation & AI Systems</h1>

<!-- HERO / POSITIONING -->
<section class="hero">
 <div class = "hero-content">
  <p>
    I work at the intersection of <strong>investment analytics</strong>,
    <strong>automation</strong>, and <strong>AI-assisted decision support</strong>,
    building systems that replace spreadsheet-heavy, person-dependent workflows
    with governed, scalable analytics platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience spans <strong>UK institutional advisory</strong>, portfolio
    analytics, performance and attribution reporting, economic assumptions
    modelling, and automation of recurring reporting and operational processes.
    Over time, my role has evolved from producing individual analyses to
    <strong>owning analytics systems end-to-end</strong> — from data ingestion
    and validation through analytics computation, interpretation, and reporting
    outputs.

<!-- WHAT I ACTUALLY DO -->
<section>
  <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>

  <p>
    Most analytics problems in investment teams are not caused by lack of
    intelligence or modelling sophistication. They are caused by fragmented
    workflows, uncontrolled assumptions, and manual processes that do not scale.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Portfolio Analytics Platforms</h3>
      <p>
        Designing portfolio analytics systems delivering performance,
        attribution, risk metrics, rolling returns, and diagnostics consistently
        across portfolios and reporting cycles.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Reporting & Workflow Automation</h3>
      <p>
        Automating recurring reporting workflows to reduce spreadsheet
        dependency while improving validation, auditability, and turnaround
        times.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>AI-Assisted Insight Layers</h3>
      <p>
        Building AI-assisted systems that convert analytics outputs into
        structured, explainable commentary — without turning decision-making
        into a black box.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SYSTEM THINKING -->
<section>
  <h2>How I Think About Analytics Systems</h2>

  <p>
    Strong analytics is not defined by complexity — it is defined by trust.
    If a system cannot be explained, validated, repeated, and reviewed, it
    eventually becomes a liability rather than an asset.
  </p>

  <p>
    I prioritise clear separation of <strong>data, logic, assumptions, and
    outputs</strong>, automation that improves control rather than speed,
    reduction of key-person risk, and systems that scale across portfolios,
    managers, and reporting cycles without breaking.
  </p>

<!-- PURPOSE -->
<section>
  <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>

  <p>
    This site is not a marketing exercise. It exists to document how I think,
    what I build, and how I approach analytics at scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a hiring manager, recruiter, or analytics leader, the case
    studies provide the clearest view of the depth and nature of my work.
