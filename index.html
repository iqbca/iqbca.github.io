          Senior investment analytics professional focused on scale, structure, and governance
        </h1>

        <p style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-top:16px;">
          I work at the intersection of investment analytics, automation, and reporting,
          helping advisory and institutional teams move away from spreadsheet-dependent
          workflows toward scalable, controlled analytics systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience spans portfolio analytics, performance reporting, economic
          assumptions modelling, and automation-led system design, with exposure to
          UK institutional advisory environments and client-facing investment workflows.

      <!-- PERSONAL POSITIONING -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>How I Think About Analytics</h2>

        <p>
          Over time, my work has shifted from producing individual analyses to designing
          systems that can deliver analytics reliably, repeatedly, and with minimal
          key-person risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe strong investment analytics is not defined by complex models alone,
          but by clear structure, validated data flows, controlled assumptions, and
          outputs that decision-makers can trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          This perspective shapes how I approach automation, reporting design, and the
          integration of tools such as Python, Excel, and Power BI into cohesive analytics
          frameworks.

      <p>
        My work focuses on replacing spreadsheet-heavy workflows with
        governed, repeatable analytics platforms using Python, Excel,

            <p>
              Designing performance, risk, attribution, and rolling-return analytics
              that scale across portfolios and reporting cycles.

      <!-- SYSTEMS MINDSET -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>From Analysis to Systems</h2>

        <p>
          Many analytics challenges are not caused by lack of insight, but by
          fragmented processes, uncontrolled assumptions, and over-reliance on
          manual steps.
        </p>

        <p>
          A significant part of my work involves identifying these structural
          weaknesses and redesigning workflows into end-to-end systems that
          can be trusted in recurring, high-stakes reporting environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          The case studies on this site document these systems in detail, including
          architecture, data flows, and measurable impact.
