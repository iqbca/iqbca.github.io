<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>Automated Financial Report Generator</h1>

  <p>
    This case study covers the design and implementation of a
    <strong>fully automated financial reporting system</strong>
    created to replace repetitive, manual report preparation
    in an investment analytics environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal was to convert reporting from an analyst-intensive
    production task into a <strong>repeatable, governed system</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Periodic client and internal reports required analysts to
    manually extract data, calculate metrics, format outputs,
    and draft commentary for every reporting cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    This process consumed significant analyst time, introduced
    formatting and calculation inconsistencies, and increased
    operational risk during peak reporting periods.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN OBJECTIVES -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Objectives</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Repeatability</h3>
      <p>
        Generate identical reports across cycles using the same
        underlying logic and structure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Auditability</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure every figure and output could be traced back to
        its data source and calculation logic.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Efficiency</h3>
      <p>
        Reduce analyst time spent on formatting and manual checks.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<section>
  <h2>Solution Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The reporting engine was designed as a Python-based automation
    pipeline that handled data preparation, analytics computation,
    and report assembly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Standardised templates were used for report structure, ensuring
    consistent presentation across clients and reporting periods.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where required, the system integrated with Excel and BI outputs,
    allowing flexibility without sacrificing control.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- OUTPUTS -->
<section>
  <h2>Reporting Outputs</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Performance & Attribution</h3>
      <p>
        Automated insertion of performance metrics and attribution
        analysis into reporting templates.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Risk & Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>
        Consistent inclusion of risk metrics and portfolio diagnostics.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Commentary Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Structured placeholders for analyst or AI-assisted commentary.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    The automated reporting system significantly reduced time spent
    on report preparation, improved consistency across outputs,
    and reduced operational risk during peak reporting cycles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analysts were able to focus more on reviewing insights and
    less on manual production tasks.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Reporting automation delivers the most value when it enforces
    structure and governance — not when it simply accelerates
    an already fragile process.
