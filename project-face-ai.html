<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>Face AI – Real-Time Face Recognition System</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents the design and implementation of a
    <strong>real-time face recognition system</strong> built using Python and
    deep learning techniques, with a focus on accuracy, performance,
    and operational control rather than experimental novelty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system was developed to explore how modern computer vision pipelines
    can be structured into a <strong>governed, production-style AI workflow</strong>,
    including confidence thresholds, fallback mechanisms, and controlled
    identity enrollment.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section>
  <h2>Problem Context</h2>

  <p>
    Real-time face recognition systems frequently fail in practice due to
    over-reliance on single-frame detection, fragile confidence handling,
    and lack of clear separation between detection, encoding, and matching logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many implementations also blur the distinction between
    <strong>identity detection</strong> and <strong>identity confirmation</strong>,
    leading to misclassification, identity drift, and poor explainability.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- OBJECTIVES -->
<section>
  <h2>System Objectives</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Design a real-time face recognition pipeline with explicit control points</li>
    <li>Separate face detection, encoding, and matching responsibilities</li>
    <li>Introduce multi-frame enrollment to improve identity stability</li>
    <li>Support GPU acceleration while maintaining CPU fallback capability</li>
    <li>Ensure confidence-driven decision making instead of binary matches</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section>
  <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

  <p>
    The system follows a modular architecture where each stage of the
    face recognition process is independently testable and replaceable.
  </p>

  <pre class="code-block">
Webcam Input
   ↓
Face Detection (DNN / MediaPipe)
   ↓
Face Encoding (Deep Embeddings)
   ↓
Similarity Matching (Cosine Distance)
   ↓
Threshold Validation
   ↓
Identity Confirmation / Unknown
  </pre>

</section>

<!-- ENROLLMENT -->
<section>
  <h2>Identity Enrollment Strategy</h2>

  <p>
    Instead of enrolling a user from a single captured frame,
    the system performs <strong>automatic multi-frame enrollment</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Multiple face samples are captured across short time intervals,
    encoded independently, and aggregated into a stable identity
    representation. This significantly reduces sensitivity to
    pose, lighting, and transient facial expressions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- GPU -->
<section>
  <h2>GPU Acceleration & Fallback Handling</h2>

  <p>
    The system automatically detects the availability of a
    CUDA-capable GPU and routes computationally intensive operations
    through GPU acceleration when possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If GPU resources are unavailable, the system seamlessly falls back
    to CPU execution without altering functional behaviour, ensuring
    portability across environments.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- GOVERNANCE -->
<section>
  <h2>Governance & Risk Controls</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Explicit similarity thresholds to prevent forced matches</li>
    <li>Unknown identity classification below confidence cut-offs</li>
    <li>Separation of enrollment and recognition modes</li>
    <li>Persistent storage of embeddings with clear label mapping</li>
    <li>Controlled update process for identity data</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- OUTCOMES -->
<section>
  <h2>Outcomes & Learnings</h2>

  <p>
    The project demonstrates how face recognition systems can be
    treated as <strong>controlled AI pipelines</strong> rather than
    black-box models.
  </p>

  <p>
    Emphasis on modularity, confidence governance, and fallback logic
    results in systems that are easier to validate, extend, and
    operate reliably in real-world conditions.
  </p>

    The complete implementation, including model handling,
    enrollment logic, and matching strategy, is available on GitHub.
