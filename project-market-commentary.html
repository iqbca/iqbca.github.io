<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>AI Market Outlook Commentary</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents a <strong>governed AI-assisted framework</strong>
    designed to generate market outlook commentary aligned with macroeconomic
    indicators and underlying economic assumptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective was to standardise market narratives while avoiding
    opinion drift, inconsistency, or unsupported claims.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Market outlook commentary is often subjective, style-dependent, and
    difficult to keep consistent across analysts and reporting cycles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Manual drafting introduced variation in tone, depth, and emphasis,
    even when underlying macro views were unchanged.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN PRINCIPLES -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Principles</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Assumption-Led</h3>
      <p>
        All commentary must trace back to defined economic assumptions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Macro Anchoring</h3>
      <p>
        Narrative generation tied to observable macro indicators
        and data trends.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>
        Guardrails to prevent speculative or unsupported statements.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- FRAMEWORK -->
<section>
  <h2>Framework Design</h2>

  <p>
    The system combines structured macro inputs, predefined narrative
    templates, and controlled AI interpretation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Commentary logic is segmented by asset class and economic theme,
    ensuring relevance and clarity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analysts retain final review and approval responsibility before
    publication.
  </p>
</section>

      <p>
        Inflation trends, growth expectations, and policy context.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    The framework improved consistency of market outlook narratives,
    reduced drafting effort, and ensured alignment between commentary
    and economic assumptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also reduced reputational and interpretative risk associated
    with ad-hoc market commentary.
  </p>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Market commentary benefits most from structure and constraint.
    AI is effective when it amplifies disciplined thinking rather
    than generating opinions.
