<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>Workflow & Operations Automation</h1>

  <p>
    This case study covers a set of automation tools designed to address
    operational bottlenecks that sit outside pure analytics but directly
    affect delivery quality, turnaround time, and team reliability.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus was on improving <strong>visibility, consistency, and control</strong>
    across recurring operational workflows.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    As analytics output scaled across portfolios and reporting cycles,
    operational tasks such as file handling, folder management, and
    work-status tracking became increasingly complex.
  </p>

  <p>
    These processes were often handled manually or inconsistently,
    creating delivery risk and reducing transparency across teams.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- AUTOMATION SCOPE -->
<section>
  <h2>Automation Scope</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Folder & File Structuring</h3>
      <p>
        Automated creation, naming, and organisation of folder structures
        and files based on reporting cycles and portfolio identifiers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>File Copying & Versioning</h3>
      <p>
        Controlled copying and versioning of working files to reduce
        overwrite errors and confusion.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Work-Status Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Automated dashboards tracking delivery status across portfolios,
        managers, and reporting deadlines.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Approach</h2>

  <p>
    The tools were designed as lightweight automation scripts integrated
    into existing workflows rather than standalone applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Emphasis was placed on clarity of logic, minimal configuration,
    and predictable behaviour to ensure adoption by non-technical users.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    Automation improved visibility into delivery status, reduced manual
    coordination effort, and lowered the risk of missed or duplicated work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teams gained a clearer view of workload distribution and bottlenecks,
    enabling more proactive management.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Operational reliability is a prerequisite for analytical excellence.
    Automating these workflows created a foundation on which analytics
    systems could operate consistently.
