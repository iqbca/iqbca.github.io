        <h1>AI-Powered Market Outlook Commentary</h1>
        <p>
          A structured commentary generation system designed to produce consistent,
          repeatable market outlook narratives using macro indicators and rule-based logic.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem Context</h2>
        <p>
          Market outlook commentary is often subjective, inconsistent across analysts,
          and difficult to reproduce across reporting cycles. Manual drafting also
          introduces time pressure and stylistic variability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>System Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The solution combines predefined macroeconomic indicators, classification
          rules, and controlled language templates to generate structured commentary
          aligned with underlying data signals.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Governance & Control</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than free-form AI output, the system enforces guardrails to ensure
          interpretability, consistency, and alignment with approved assumptions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The framework significantly reduces analyst effort while improving
          consistency and comparability of market outlook narratives across periods.
