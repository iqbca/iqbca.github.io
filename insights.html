  <h1>Insights</h1>

  <p>
    This section captures how I think about analytics, automation,
    and AI in real investment environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The focus is not theory, but practical lessons learned while
    building and maintaining systems used in production.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- INSIGHT 1 -->
<div class="insight-card">
  <h3>Why Analytics Systems Fail at Scale</h3>

  <p>
    Most analytics systems do not fail because the models are wrong.
    They fail because the surrounding system is fragile.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fragmented spreadsheets, undocumented assumptions, manual overrides,
    and key-person dependency introduce hidden operational risk.
    At small scale, this is manageable. At institutional scale, it is not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scalability is a governance problem before it is a technical problem.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- INSIGHT 2 -->
<div class="insight-card">
  <h3>Automation Is About Control, Not Speed</h3>

  <p>
    Automation is often justified by time savings. In practice,
    its real value lies in control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well-designed automation enforces consistent logic, reduces interpretation
    drift, and improves auditability. Poor automation simply hides complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    If automation makes a process faster but less explainable,
    it is a liability.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- INSIGHT 3 -->
<div class="insight-card">
  <h3>The Hidden Risk in Economic Assumptions</h3>

  <p>
    Inflation and return assumptions quietly influence almost every
    investment output — performance expectations, scenario analysis,
    and client communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    When assumptions are handled manually or inconsistently, they
    become one of the largest unpriced risks in analytics systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Treating assumptions as governed infrastructure is critical
    at scale.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- INSIGHT 4 -->
<div class="insight-card">
  <h3>AI Works Best as an Interpretation Layer</h3>

  <p>
    AI adds the most value when it assists interpretation rather than
    replacing judgement.
  </p>

  <p>
    High-value use cases include drafting structured commentary,
    highlighting anomalies, and narrowing analyst attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI should reduce friction — not responsibility.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- INSIGHT 5 -->
<div class="insight-card">
  <h3>Design for Review, Not Perfection</h3>

  <p>
    Analytics systems should be built assuming outputs will be questioned,
    assumptions will change, and errors will occur.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good systems make review easy and obvious. Bad systems make
    review political and time-consuming.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trust is earned through reviewability, not complexity.
  </p>
