<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>Excel–Python Integrated Portfolio Tracker</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents a hybrid analytics system designed to bridge
    the gap between <strong>Excel-based workflows</strong> and
    <strong>Python-driven analytics engines</strong> in real investment teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective was not to eliminate Excel, but to
    <strong>retain its usability while removing its analytical fragility</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Excel remains the primary interface for many investment workflows,
    but complex portfolio analytics implemented purely in spreadsheets
    are difficult to validate, scale, and govern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Existing trackers relied on manual data updates, hidden formulas,
    and analyst-specific logic, creating inconsistency and operational risk.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN INTENT -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Intent</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        Preserve Excel as a familiar interface for inputs, outputs,
        and review.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Reliability</h3>
      <p>
        Move all computation, validation, and historical handling
        into Python.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>
        Enforce consistent logic and validation checks outside Excel.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section>
  <h2>System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    Excel was used strictly as a front-end for data entry and output
    presentation, while Python acted as the computation and validation layer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inputs such as transactions, portfolio identifiers, and dates were
    captured in structured Excel templates and passed to Python scripts
    for processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Python handled price fetching, return calculations, risk metrics,
    rolling analytics, and validation before returning clean outputs
    to Excel.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ANALYTICS -->
<section>
  <h2>Analytics Coverage</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Performance Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Absolute and relative performance calculations across time periods.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Historical Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Automated handling of historical prices and transaction dates.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Validation & Checks</h3>
      <p>
        Automated validation of inputs, missing data, and calculation errors.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    The hybrid approach reduced spreadsheet risk while preserving usability,
    improved consistency of analytics outputs, and allowed the system
    to scale across portfolios with minimal manual intervention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analysts were able to focus on interpretation rather than debugging
    spreadsheets.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    The most effective analytics systems respect existing workflows while
    quietly removing their failure points. Excel did not need to be removed —
    it needed to be constrained.
