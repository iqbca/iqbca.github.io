<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>AI-Powered Portfolio Analytics Platform</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents the design and ownership of an
    <strong>institutional-grade portfolio analytics platform</strong>
    built to deliver consistent performance, attribution, risk,
    and diagnostic analytics across portfolios and reporting cycles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary objective was not to increase analytical sophistication,
    but to replace fragmented, spreadsheet-heavy workflows with a
    <strong>governed, scalable analytics system</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Portfolio analytics were historically produced through a combination
    of spreadsheets, manual adjustments, and analyst-specific logic.
    While workable at small scale, this approach introduced significant
    challenges as portfolio coverage expanded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key issues included inconsistent analytics across portfolios,
    limited reusability of logic, difficulty validating outputs,
    and heavy dependency on individual analysts to interpret results.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- OBJECTIVES -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Objectives</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure identical analytics logic and outputs across portfolios,
        managers, and reporting periods.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        Enable onboarding of new portfolios without exponential increases
        in manual effort or complexity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Governance</h3>
      <p>
        Separate data, assumptions, analytics logic, and presentation
        layers to improve control and auditability.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section>
  <h2>Solution Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The platform was designed as a modular analytics engine using
    <strong>Python</strong> for computation and
    <strong>Power BI</strong> for presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data ingestion, analytics computation, and visualisation were
    deliberately separated, allowing changes in one layer without
    breaking downstream outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    This design enabled analytics logic to be reused across portfolios
    and reporting cycles while maintaining consistent outputs.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ANALYTICS COVERAGE -->
<section>
  <h2>Analytics Coverage</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Performance Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Absolute and relative returns across periods, including cumulative
        and periodic performance views.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Attribution Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Multi-level attribution across asset classes and managers,
        enabling clear performance explanation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Risk & Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>
        Volatility, drawdowns, downside metrics, and diagnostic checks
        to support risk-aware decision-making.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Rolling Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Rolling returns and consistency metrics to assess behaviour
        across market cycles.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    The platform significantly reduced manual effort per reporting cycle,
    improved consistency across portfolios, and enabled analytics reuse
    across clients and time periods.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most importantly, it shifted analytics from being analyst-dependent
    outputs to <strong>infrastructure-level capability</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    The value of the platform was not increased complexity, but improved
    trust, repeatability, and scalability. Analytics became a system that
    could be reviewed, validated, and evolved without breaking.
