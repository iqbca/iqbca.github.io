<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>Economic Assumptions Automation</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents the automation of
    <strong>economic assumptions frameworks</strong>,
    covering both inflation and long-term return modelling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective was not to predict markets, but to ensure that
    assumptions used across analytics and reporting were
    <strong>consistent, governed, and reproducible</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Inflation and return assumptions influence nearly every
    investment output — from performance expectations to
    scenario analysis and client communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    Historically, these assumptions were maintained manually,
    often across spreadsheets, with limited version control
    and inconsistent application across analyses.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN OBJECTIVES -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Objectives</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure the same assumptions are applied across all
        analytics and reporting outputs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Auditability</h3>
      <p>
        Enable clear tracing of assumptions used at any point
        in time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        Support scenario analysis without manual rework.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- FRAMEWORK -->
<section>
  <h2>Framework Design</h2>

  <p>
    Assumptions were modelled as parameter-driven inputs rather
    than hard-coded values, allowing controlled updates without
    breaking downstream analytics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Separate models were maintained for inflation projections
    and long-term return expectations, with shared governance
    controls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Versioning ensured historical analyses could be reproduced
    exactly as they were generated.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- COVERAGE -->
<section>
  <h2>Assumptions Coverage</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Inflation Modelling</h3>
      <p>
        Structured inflation assumptions supporting real-return
        calculations and long-term projections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Return Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        Asset-class level return assumptions used across
        portfolio analytics and reporting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Scenario Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Ability to assess alternative assumption sets under
        different economic conditions.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    Automation improved governance of assumptions, reduced
    inconsistency across analytics outputs, and enabled faster
    scenario analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also significantly lowered the operational and
    reputational risk associated with undocumented or
    misapplied assumptions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Economic assumptions are one of the most underappreciated
    sources of risk in analytics systems. Treating them as
    governed infrastructure rather than ad-hoc inputs is
    critical at scale.
