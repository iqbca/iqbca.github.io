<!-- INTRO -->
<section>
  <h1>AI Portfolio Insights Engine</h1>

  <p>
    This case study documents the design of an
    <strong>AI-assisted portfolio insights engine</strong>
    created to convert structured analytics outputs into
    consistent, explainable investment commentary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The objective was not to automate judgement, but to
    <strong>reduce repetitive interpretation work</strong>
    while preserving analyst oversight and accountability.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CONTEXT -->
<section>
  <h2>Context & Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Portfolio analytics outputs were accurate but required
    manual interpretation and narrative writing for every
    reporting cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    This led to inconsistent commentary styles, variable depth
    of explanation, and significant time spent on repetitive
    drafting tasks.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DESIGN PRINCIPLES -->
<section>
  <h2>Design Principles</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Explainability</h3>
      <p>
        Every narrative statement must be traceable to
        underlying metrics and data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        AI outputs are restricted by predefined rules,
        templates, and thresholds.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human Oversight</h3>
      <p>
        Analysts review, edit, and approve all generated
        commentary before delivery.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->
<section>
  <h2>System Design</h2>

  <p>
    The engine operates on structured analytics inputs such
    as performance, attribution, risk metrics, and rolling
    analysis outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    These inputs are mapped to narrative templates and logic
    layers that guide AI-generated text, ensuring relevance
    and consistency.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AI layer is deliberately constrained to interpretation
    tasks and does not modify or generate analytics.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- OUTPUTS -->
<section>
  <h2>Outputs & Use Cases</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Portfolio Commentary</h3>
      <p>
        Structured explanations of performance drivers,
        risk changes, and attribution effects.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Change Detection</h3>
      <p>
        Highlighting periods or metrics requiring analyst
        attention.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Standardised narrative tone and structure across
        portfolios and reporting cycles.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<section>
  <h2>Impact & Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    The insights engine reduced time spent on narrative
    drafting, improved consistency of commentary, and
    allowed analysts to focus on review and interpretation.
  </p>

  <p>
    It also created a foundation for integrating AI safely
    into analytics workflows without undermining trust.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- TAKEAWAYS -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    AI adds the most value when used to narrow attention and
    reduce friction — not when it attempts to replace
    analytical judgement.
