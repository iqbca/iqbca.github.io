      <!-- SCOPE & OWNERSHIP -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Scope & Ownership</h2>

        <p>
          My roles have consistently involved ownership of analytics delivery rather
          than isolated analysis. This includes responsibility for end-to-end
          analytics pipelines — from data ingestion and validation through analytics
          computation to client-ready reporting outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          A significant focus has been on replacing manual, spreadsheet-heavy
          workflows with automated, repeatable systems that reduce operational risk,
          improve governance, and scale across portfolios and clients without
          increasing dependency on individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          In institutional environments, this ownership extends to quality control,
          documentation, versioning of assumptions, and adherence to delivery
          timelines for recurring reporting cycles.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SELECTED SYSTEMS BUILT -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Selected Systems & Platforms Built</h2>

        <p>
          Over the course of my career, I have designed and delivered multiple
          analytics and automation systems used in live reporting and advisory
          environments. Selected examples include:
        </p>

        <p>
          An AI-powered portfolio analytics platform covering performance,
          attribution, risk metrics, and rolling returns, designed for institutional
          reporting and Power BI integration.
        </p>

        <p>
          An automated economic assumptions framework covering inflation modelling
          and long-term return assumptions, incorporating governance, version control,
          and repeatable reporting outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hybrid Excel–Python analytics systems enabling multi-manager portfolio
          tracking while retaining Excel usability and enforcing Python-based
          validation and computation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Python-driven financial report generation engines and operational automation
          frameworks replacing manual file handling, status tracking, and repetitive
          reporting tasks.
